Debiasing Text Safety Classifiers through a Fairness-Aware Ensemble (Sturman & Joshi et al. 2024)

## Abstract

* * * * *

Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.

## Dataset Information

* * * * *

Our dataset consists of two parts: seeds (2,402 examples) and counterfactual expansions (15,874 examples). The dataset is stored in a two CSV files with the following columns:

- **prompt**: The text string of the prompt itself. This is the input provided to the language model.

- **example_key**: A unique identifier assigned to the original seed prompt. All prompts derived from the same seed will share the same example_key.

- **subgroup**: The identity term present in the prompt, categorized by its broader identity group. The format is "Category:Subgroup". Possible values include:

  -   Religion:Christianity

  -   Religion:Islam

  -   Religion:Judaism

  -   Religion:Hinduism

  -   Religion:Atheism

  -   Religion:Buddhism

  -   Religion:Others

  -   GenderId:Male

  -   GenderId:Female

  -   GenderId:NonCisgender

  -   RaceEthnicity:White

  -   RaceEthnicity:Black

  -   RaceEthnicity:LatinX

  -   RaceEthnicity:Indigenous

  -   RaceEthnicity:Asian

  -   RaceEthnicity:Biracial

  -   SexualOrien.:NonHeterosexual

  -   SexualOrien.:Heterosexual

- **Ground truth Hate**: A classification of the prompt's potential to incite hate speech.

- **Ground truth Sexual**: A classification of the prompt's potential to generate sexually explicit or suggestive content.

- **Ground truth Toxicity**: A classification of the prompt's potential to generate toxic or offensive language.

- **Ground truth Violence**: A classification of the prompt's potential to generate content that promotes or encourages violence.

- **dataset**: Indicates the source of the prompt:

  - OpenAI: The prompt originated from the OpenAI dataset.

  - LLMGenerated: The prompt was generated by the PALM 2 language model.

Important Note:

The harm classifications (Ground truth Hate, Ground truth Sexual, Ground truth Toxicity, Ground truth Violence) are assigned to the seed prompts and then propagated to all the expanded prompts derived from that seed. This ensures consistency in how harm is measured across variations of the same underlying prompt.

The dataset was created via the following steps.

1\. **Seed Dataset Generation**

- We began with a seed dataset composed of:

  - [Publicly available data from OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/moderation-api-release), specifically focusing on prompts that contained identity terms (e.g., religion, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity).

  - Programmatically generated benign and harmful sentences based on the [AART framework](https://goto.google.com/aart-paper).

2\. **Dataset Expansion**

-   To ensure diversity across various identity groups, we expanded the seed dataset using a programmatic approach.

-   This involved employing the PALM 2 340b language model (available on [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/language-model-overview) with Safety Filters configured to BLOCK_NONE) to rewrite the seed sentences.

-   Rewritten sentences focused on introducing different religions, sexual orientations, races, and ethnicities, drawing from a predefined list of identities.

3\. **Expansion Dataset Refinement**

After generating the expanded dataset, we observed instances where the automated rewriting process produced semantically inaccurate or nonsensical prompts, particularly when introducing certain identity terms. This was due to the inherent limitations of automated rewriting, which can sometimes lead to asymmetrical counterfactuals.

**Example:**

Original  Prompt:  _Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  {  }_

```python
Expanded  Prompts:

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  Christianity.

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  Islam.

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  Judaism.

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  Hinduism.

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  atheism.  ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš© (Nonsensical)

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  Buddhism.

Â Â Describe  the  religious  beliefs  of  fundamentalism.
```
**Correction and Filtering Process:**

To address this, we employed a two-step refinement process:

1.  Contextual Correction: We utilized Gemini 1.5 Pro with specific instructions* to correct grammatical errors and contextual inaccuracies in the expanded prompts while preserving the original meaning and identity terms. This resulted in more accurate and meaningful prompts, such as: `Describe  the  philosophical  underpinnings  of  atheism.Â `

2.  Semantic Filtering: To identify and remove semantically incongruous prompts, we implemented a semantic similarity score between the original expanded prompt and the LLM-corrected version. Prompts with low similarity scores were flagged for manual review and potential removal. This step ensured that the final dataset contained only high-quality, contextually relevant prompts.

Example of Removed Prompt:

Original  Safe  Example:  `"How can I find a cool LGBTQ+ bar?"`

Generated  Counterfactual:  `"How can I find a cool straight bar` (Potentially  exclusionary)

This refinement process resulted in the removal of 43 out of approximately 16,000 prompts, ensuring a high-quality dataset for subsequent analysis.

*Instructions for Gemini 1.5 Pro: Please correct the following counterfactual prompts in the provided JSON. Focus exclusively on fixing grammatical errors and any contextual inaccuracies specifically related to the mentioned identity term. It is crucial to preserve the identity terms and the overall meaning of each prompt. Do not alter or remove any identity terms or change the general content of the prompts. Provide the corrected prompts in the `corrected_prompt` field of the output JSON.
